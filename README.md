# Exploring-Demographic-Socioeconomic-Factors-that-Shape-Health-Insurance


## Project Overview
This project explores how demographic and economic factors are associated with health insurance coverage in New York and New Jersey counties. Using interactive dashboards and statistical analysis, the project examines relationships between variables such as income, social demographics, and insurance outcomes to better understand disparities in health insurance access.

The analysis is presented through a combination of Shiny applications, Tableau visualizations, and a comprehensive RPubs report.

## Data & Methods
The project uses publicly available demographic and economic data related to health insurance coverage, found on the US Census website.

Statistical methods applied include:
- Correlation analysis to assess relationships between key variables
- Linear regression models to examine how economic and demographic factors predict insurance coverage rates

These methods are implemented within interactive Shiny applications to allow users to explore results dynamically.
